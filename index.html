Hopefully this will provide some insight for prospective students, as well as to people looking to make the leap into the aviation industry.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">As a little background on myself, I am 26 years old (as of starting this) and from the UK. I graduated from the University of Warwick in 2015 with a masters degree in computer science (MEng) followed by an MBA from the University of New Mexico in 2017. I also competed in track &amp; field for 10 years, culminating with a 1:50 800m best and multiple championship medals.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">I am beginning flight training at the age of 26. My only prior flight experience is a 40 minute introductory flight in Albuquerque.</p>

Takeoff on runway 9, climbed to 1,000ft before turning south along the coast and descending to 500ft. Continued southward to our turning point, the Cape Florida Lighthouse, and proceeded north passed the Virginia Key VOR (VKZ) and back to KFXE to land on runway 9. Discussed various aspects of flying, instrumentation and the instructors own experience with ATP.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">Passed the Private Pilot Airplane written exam today. I scored 98%, with a single, simple question incorrect. At least it gives the DPE something to talk about for the practical exam! For preparation, I read the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/">PHAK</a> back-to-front, completed all of the resources King Schools has to offer, and made use of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sportys.com/pilotshop/learn-to-fly/faa-private-pilot-test-prep.html">Sporty's Study Buddy (free)</a>.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">First day at ATP! Unfortunately no flying due to bad weather. Spent a good amount of time getting to know my instructor and fellow students. Did some weight and balance work and walked through the preflight checklist.</p>

                                <h4 class="timeline-title">Day 2</h4>
                                <p class="timeline-text">The day started bright and early at 0630. My instructor gave me a lot of freedom to do things independently, despite this being my first lesson. We completed the preflight checklist and taxied to the runup area where I experienced my first mechanical malfunction. The left magneto wasn’t playing ball, so my instructor attempted to resolve it but to no avail. Back to the ramp we go. I suggested we try the left magneto one more time before parking the plane and grabbing another. Luckily the taxiing must have cleared it up and we were good to go again. At least I got some good taxiing practice.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">During the lesson, we briefly had a go at level flight, turns, climbs, descents and a combination of such before moving on to sample more exciting things such as steep turns, power-off and power-on stalls. I was surprised at how difficult it was to actually stall a Cessna 172. Time flew by and we headed back but the excitement wasn’t over yet. My instructor demonstrated a landing for me to observe, before taking off again to let me have a go. First approach we got issued a go-around due to traffic, before making a decent first landing (with a little assistance).

                                <p class="timeline-text">This is the beginning of the first 'module', which involves practicing steep turns, power-on stalls, power-off stalls, emergency decents, slow flight, S-turns and turns-around-a-point. For my first lesson I performed some steep turns, power-on and power-off stalls as well as some slow flight maneuvering. I was surprised at how difficult it is to stall a C172. It takes a lot of effort to fight the aircraft as it continuously tries to recover from the nose-high, low airspeed attitude.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">After a brief introduction into some of the manuevers I'll be expected to perform as a private pilot, the program has moved onto takeoffs and landings. I made sure I studied the Cessna 172 supplement to understand the elements of an approach and the control inputs needed to be made to ensure a safe and smooth landing. It is easy to read what needs to be done but writting doesn't transfer the tacticle feel of the plane into your brain. One of my professor's at the University of New Mexico loved the phrase 'fingertip knowledge', meaning knowledge that cannot be learned from reading, only from experience.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">I found flying in the pattern pretty straight forward and completed approaches with relative ease. I was having difficulty judging the flare in terms of both timing and magnitude. My instructor assured me that this is normal for rookies and is something that I'll develop quite quickly over time.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">I sat both the IRA and FII written tests today and passed with flying colors, scoring 100% on both. I believe many hours of X-Plane helped understand decision heights, RNAV's, minimums and a bunch of other chart related knowledge. Sheppard Air's software filled the gaps and worked perfectly as claimed. </p>

                                <h4 class="timeline-title">TOL Evaluation</h4>
                                <p class="timeline-text">Today I had my first flight with a different instructor and no assistance - it was all up to me. The goal of the evaluation was to demonstrate at least 3 normal takeoffs and landings, a go-around and satisfactoy traffic pattern flying. Runway 9 at FXE was in use, there was a small crosswind and the air got turbulent as the evaluation progressed, making it a little bit more tricky but I achieved all the goals and had a good time flying.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">That is it for focusing primarily on takeoffs and landings. The next phase is to prepare for solo flight.</p>
