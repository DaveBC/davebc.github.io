Hopefully this will provide some insight for prospective students, as well as to people looking to make the leap into the aviation industry.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">As a little background on myself, I am 26 years old (as of starting this) and from the UK. I graduated from the University of Warwick in 2015 with a masters degree in computer science (MEng) followed by an MBA from the University of New Mexico in 2017. I also competed in track &amp; field for 10 years, culminating with a 1:50 800m best and multiple championship medals.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">I am beginning flight training at the age of 26. My only prior flight experience is a 40 minute introductory flight in Albuquerque.</p>

For preparation, I read the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/">PHAK</a> back-to-front, completed all of the resources King Schools has to offer, and made use of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sportys.com/pilotshop/learn-to-fly/faa-private-pilot-test-prep.html">Sporty's Study Buddy (free)</a>.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">First day at ATP! Unfortunately no flying due to bad weather. Spent a good amount of time getting to know my instructor and fellow students. Did some weight and balance work and walked through the preflight checklist.</p>

                                <h4 class="timeline-title">Day 2</h4>
                                <p class="timeline-text">The day started bright and early at 0630. My instructor gave me a lot of freedom to do things independently, despite this being my first lesson. We completed the preflight checklist and taxied to the runup area where I experienced my first mechanical malfunction. The left magneto wasn’t playing ball, so my instructor attempted to resolve it but to no avail. Back to the ramp we go. I suggested we try the left magneto one more time before parking the plane and grabbing another. Luckily the taxiing must have cleared it up and we were good to go again. At least I got some good taxiing practice.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">During the lesson, we briefly had a go at level flight, turns, climbs, descents and a combination of such before moving on to sample more exciting things such as steep turns, power-off and power-on stalls. I was surprised at how difficult it was to actually stall a Cessna 172. Time flew by and we headed back but the excitement wasn’t over yet. My instructor demonstrated a landing for me to observe, before taking off again to let me have a go. First approach we got issued a go-around due to traffic, before making a decent first landing (with a little assistance).

                                <p class="timeline-text">This is the beginning of the first 'module', which involves practicing steep turns, power-on stalls, power-off stalls, emergency decents, slow flight, S-turns and turns-around-a-point. For my first lesson I performed some steep turns, power-on and power-off stalls as well as some slow flight maneuvering. I was surprised at how difficult it is to stall a C172. It takes a lot of effort to fight the aircraft as it continuously tries to recover from the nose-high, low airspeed attitude.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">After a brief introduction into some of the manuevers I'll be expected to perform as a private pilot, the program has moved onto takeoffs and landings. I made sure I studied the Cessna 172 supplement to understand the elements of an approach and the control inputs needed to be made to ensure a safe and smooth landing. It is easy to read what needs to be done but writting doesn't transfer the tacticle feel of the plane into your brain. One of my professor's at the University of New Mexico loved the phrase 'fingertip knowledge', meaning knowledge that cannot be learned from reading, only from experience.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">I found flying in the pattern pretty straight forward and completed approaches with relative ease. I was having difficulty judging the flare in terms of both timing and magnitude. My instructor assured me that this is normal for rookies and is something that I'll develop quite quickly over time.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">I sat both the IRA and FII written tests today and passed with flying colors, scoring 100% on both. I believe many hours of X-Plane helped understand decision heights, RNAV's, minimums and a bunch of other chart related knowledge. Sheppard Air's software filled the gaps and worked perfectly as claimed. </p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">Today I had my first flight with a different instructor and no assistance - it was all up to me. The goal of the evaluation was to demonstrate at least 3 normal takeoffs and landings, a go-around and satisfactoy traffic pattern flying. Runway 9 at FXE was in use, there was a small crosswind and the air got turbulent as the evaluation progressed, making it a little bit more tricky but I achieved all the goals and had a good time flying.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">That is it for focusing primarily on takeoffs and landings. The next phase is to prepare for solo flight.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">First taste of night flying on a clear, but warm, night. Flew out of FXE up to Stuart (KSUA) for a full stop landing before returning to FXE to complete the 10 take-offs and landings required for the Private Pilot License.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">I found it suprising how difficult it is to see an airport at night. I was expecting the runway to be lit up like a christmas tree - like what I've experienced in X-Plane 11. This was far from reality, in fact you end up looking for the black holes.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">Today was the first time I took the controls of an aircraft with no-one beside me. I felt more than ready and comfortable. My father wished me good luck and said try not to crash. The flight was nothing exciting, consisting of just a couple of laps in the pattern. I did make my best landing to date but of course there was no one around to see it.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">The freedom of flying solo in the pattern quickly became tedious and I was looking forward to some cross country flying - proper flying that involves planning and navigation. ATP has a policy of flying only approved routes - which for the FXE location involves flying to Airglades (2IS) to Punta Gorda (KPGD) on the west coast of Florida, before flying direct back to FXE. This ensures familiarity before soloing and that PPL requirements are all met.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">The flight was enjoyable. I used a combination of pilotage and dead reckoning to navigate to our first stop at Airglades. VOR's were used to navigate to Punta Gorda and GPS was used to fly direct back to FXE.</p>

                                <h4 class="timeline-title">Solo Cross Country</h4>
                                <p class="timeline-text">I have flown to Punta Gorda via Airglades three times and now it is time for me to complete the route by myself. Unfortunately this took a little longer to accomplish than expected. Summer in South Florida is characterised by thunderstorms, and it so happens that the east coast is typically clear in the morning - good for flying. However, the weather on the west coast was giving me problems and ATP are very strict for giving approval for a student to conduct a solo cross country.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">After numerous attempts, the weather cooperated and I was given approval to fly cross country, but only to Airglades and back. This gave me some solo cross country time that counted towards my PPL, but not enough so the next cross country has to be the full route.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">I now have a block of time allocated for preparation for my checkride that is rapidly approaching. Today I practiced some maneuvers that I haven't performed in a while. It was surprising to me how much easier the maneuvers are now that I am more comfortable with the aircraft and have a better feel for the controls - previously I felt like I was always reacting to the aircraft rather than controlling it. I will need to put a little bit more practice into short-field and soft-field landings as the final touches to my preparation.</p>

                                <p class="timeline-text">I passed! The checkride was fairly straight forward and nothing was unexpected. My examiner served 6 years in the USAF before flying for United for 38 years! I was in awe of his impressive resume. He was very fair and clearly laid out the plan of action for the checkride, which put my nerves at ease. </p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">I was happy with my performance. The oral portion was a piece of cake and the flying portion was nothing new to me. I did go-around on my final short-field landing as I felt I was going long. We had a tail wind, which I knew was going to make the landing a little challenging to keep within standards. My next attempt was within the 200 feet allowance but a little flat. The examiner was pleased and stated that if I had landed first time, he would have been happy - I guess my pursuit for perfection gets in the way sometimes.</p>

                                <h4 class="timeline-title">Instrument Training</h4>
                                <p class="timeline-text">Following the completion of the private stage, it is straight into the next, which is instrument. This phase of training involves a lot of simulator time. Pretty much every flight is flown first in a simulator. This avoids wasting flight time by ensuring you are prepared for the lesson. Today involved just basic instrument manuevers - level flight, standard rate turns, climbs, fixed-speed climbs and so on. Unfortunately, it involves wearing foggles or view-limiting devices so I don't get to spend much time admiring the view out the window.</p>
                                <p class="timeline-text">I feel massively prepared for this portion of training due to the vast amount of instrument flying I have done on my simulator at home. I am comfortable with flying with sole reference to the instruments as well as reading departure, arrival and approach plates. I suspect the most difficult part of this phase of training is workload management, since there is no autopilot and no crew to distribute task load.</p>
