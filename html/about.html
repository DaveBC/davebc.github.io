I'm a twenty-something year old guy originally from the rolling green hills of South Wales. I am currently living in Albuquerque, New Mexico where I am a part of the University of New Mexico's track and field team while studying for an MBA. I'm very lucky to have the opportunity to live the life of an athlete in such an amazing location. The weather is beautiful, very different from what I'm used to, and the views are breathtaking. On top of that, the facilities are incredible and I have met some wonderful people. And I've only been there for one semester!

I graduated from the University of Warwick in June 2015 with a master’s degree in computer science. Four years of hard work paid off and I earned a first. On the very first day I thought four years was going to be a long time. Boy, was I wrong! Many, many lectures, projects, problem sheets and lines of code later and I was sat in my last exam thinking despite all the stress this causes me, I am actually going to miss this. I now owe the government £30k for the privilege but would I change anything? Absolutely not.

At home I have my amazingly supportive parents, a bigger but younger brother, and two dogs, Pippa and Xena. My parents work really hard to make sure I pursue whatever I choose to. A good example of how much my parents support me is that my father happily drives me three hours up to Manchester just so I can run two laps of a track and then drive home again. We usually do this two or three times a year. ​Honestly, I don't know where I'd be without them.
